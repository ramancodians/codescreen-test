# Dropyacht's Principal Frontend Assessment

## Description

Your goal is to create a functional Checkers game where two players can take turns making legal moves on the game board. The game should follow the standard Checkers rules, including capturing opponent pieces and kinging pieces that reach the opposite end of the board.

Here is a short video that covers almost all the core concepts of the game: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW9k_C4vFU)

**NOTE: We run plagarism checks off common open source libraries, and you will fail the test if you copy code.**

## Instructions

#### Setup

The project is bootstraped using create-react-app. Running `npm install` and `npm start` should start the dev version of the web-app. We have `typescript` already installed, so that can be leveraged during development. `src/App/components/Board.tsx` will be a nice starting point to create the 8x8 game board.

#### Rules and tips

- You're allowed and encouraged to install helper libraries. Feel free to add CSS styling to make the game visually appealing.
- Any type of React components are acceptable, but we'd prefer you use functional components with hooks.
- You're allowed to use the file structure of your choice, but we'll be looking for candidates to design clean and modular code
- You're allowed to use a state management tool of any kind, and persistence is not required. It is OK to begin the game from beginning in case the page changes or the board unmounts. Routing is not required for the task.
- You're allowed to choose between allowing the user to drag and drop the piece or allowing the user to click it, ensure only legal moves are playable.
- Add comments wherever necessary, and keep function names relevant for the reviewer to have a better understanding of how things work.
- If possible, update the README with a few thoughts on your approach and anything else you want your reviewer to know when reviewing your code.

Remember, this is an opportunity to showcase your skills and problem-solving abilities. We're looking for a principal level engineer who can turn an open-ended problem into an elegant solution. Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your implementation!
